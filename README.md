### Background Materials & Pre-Reading

My suggestion is to either re-write or rehash all the materials. Most of the materials are seriously out of date are and there some examples which are incorrect.

I would prefer if the students are showed the correct resources.

Mozzila web developer has been the go to resource for proper way of learning. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

I am personally not a big fan of using w3schools as they have been known to provide incorrect information and they tend to take a lot of shortcuts in web development which is frowned upon. (This was like a few years ago, they have improved a lot since then)

One issue is that instead of providing "full projects" on Moodle we should provide source codes instead. The reason we should do this is because if we do not students will graduate under the impression that they will always need to share around 100 MB files for projects. So, instead of uploading full projects I sugges that we provide sources will run instructions for them.

### Week 1 (Web Site Design & Usability)

Proposed change to

### Week 1 (Introduction to Web Development & Visual Studio)

The pre-requisite reading this week is - HTML

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML

### Proposed Learning Objective

- Basic HTML features. Form features
- Button, Select Box, TextArea and etc
- How to use HTMLHelpers in Visual Studio.

#### DoubtFire

- Basic HTML features inside Visual Studio using HTMLHelpers

Here we need to place an emphasis on how the state of the web is constantly evolving. Here, we create a stater project. 

We show how to use certain features of the IDE. For example, how to use the Auto complete feature, how to use Auto Format and various things. How to use the Peek tool. How to look at the API.

This is just to get them used to how to use an Enterprise level IDE. Show them the benefits of using an IDE instead of using BlueJ or notepad.

We explain how the current project is and the various items. We point out to them in which week they will learn how to achieve certain features.

For this week, we introduce them to multiple reading materials. For example,
- How to use version handling (Git) - Introduce them to tools website like GitHub and explain how enterprise tools like SourceTree and Jira

#### Challenge exercise for students.

- Set up your own Git repository using Github.

### Week 2 (Introduction to Form-based Application)

Proposed changed to

### Week 2 (The Front End & Usability)

The pre-requisite reading this week is - CSS

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

#### Proposed Learning Objective

- Understand the difference between the various HTML standards.
- Understand how the nature of responsiveness.
- Understand that each browser behaves differently.
- Modern web design principles. Usability. 
- Understand how to use developer tools.
- How to use ASP.NET HTMLHelpers in combination with Bootstrap

#### DoubtFire Task
- Using simple Bootstrap Feature

My suggestion for this week, is to introduce to them a front end framework. Either using Bootstrap or Foundation. We show them how design plays a role in creating a web application and more important how to create a responsive web application. So the objective of this lab is two fold, we not only teach them CSS, we also teach them how to use a front end framework. 

One easy thing that we can show them, is that how the select box looks and feels different in Safari vs Chrome and etc. How this will impact user experience etc. Overall its is more important for them to understand how to use developer tools.

We also mention that we will show them regarding the current UI trends later in the unit which includes React, Angular and VueJS.

The sample projects for this week, will show them how a simple web application will look on various resolutions and how responsiveness is achieved. Tell them about how VS projects by default uses bootstrap.

We also introduce them to developer tools that allows them to edit CSS live.

My previous guide was written for Bootstrap 3. Bootstrap 4 is now becoming the standard. Starting next year, most developers would have adopted it.

#### Challenge Exercise for Students

- Easy - Using responsive images and Youtube Embeds with Bootstrap
- Medium - Using Foundation or https://github.com/yahoo/pure
- Hard - Using CSS media queries and flexboxes to manually create a reponsive UI (CSS3)
- Expert - Concept of CSS preprocessors. (Less VS SASS)

### Week 3 (Web Forms vs ASP.NET MVC)

#### Proposed Learning Objective

- Understand how Web Forms differs from MVC
- Understand the advantages of the MVC.

#### DoubtFire Submission

- A table describing how WebForms vs ASP.NET differs in terms of developing.
- MVC project submission with the processing of a simple form.

For this Week 3, we need to make sure the students really understand the MVC architecture in comparison to the traditional ASP.NET (Web Forms). The main problem with this is because students that are fairly new to programming have no idea what the advantages are. Most of the definitions given are not clear enough for the students to undertand. This is even more true because terms like "ViewState" is used when comparing two of them.

In my opinion we can describe it in an easier way so that the students can understand.

For example, traditionally when developing web applications, each page would have a "CodeBehind" that tells what happens when a certain action takes place. So, every single page that is created have a CodeBehind. When the MVC comes, into play the thought process is very different. So, instead of having backing codes behind each page, these pages have actions. The main issue here is that people have different opinions of the MVC. We need to use a proper Microsoft resource.

#### Provided Project

The lab showcase for this week, would require _two_ projects. One project done using Web Forms and another using the MVC pattern. We show case how the MVC will increase the testability of an application. 


### Week 4 (ASP.NET MVC Application)

Prerequisite reading - Programming
 
#### Proposed Learning Objective

- Understanding basics of programming in in C#. Features that C# have like Linq.
- Understand the difference between the Database First & Code First approach
- Understand the Scaffolding framework.
- Understand the MVC Framework in more detail. 

### DoubtFire Submission

- DatabaseFirst approach
- CodeFirst approach
- Document that details the difference between two approaches.

The main objective this week was to show case Code First vs Database First. Here, the main issue was that the students was only shown the Database First approach, they were not shown the CodeFirst approach.

So, for the lab demo this week, we will show them two approaches. One done using CodeFirst and another using DatabaseFirst.

In the case of the Database first approach, we need to place an emphasis of selecting the correct data type. Most students that completed database should have a good understanding of the database selection.

#### Sample Project

So for this week, we need two projects. One project that uses the Database First approach and another using Code First.

We also tell them the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. 

One important thing that was not pointed out is the importance of the web config.

Here we need to emphasis on good programming practices regarding how to properly do something. Most sutdents that did the database first approach did not think carefully and rushed into using the Scaffolding framework.

Some concepts here were not well explained to the students.

For example
- ViewBag
- More importantly how the GET and POST works in the MVC framework.

#### Challenges

- Easy - Returning information with ViewBag
- Medium - Instead of using 2 tables, we now introduce 3 table and a many to many relationship.
- Hard - Obtaining information with Linq.
- Expert - How to use PM in Visual Studio to update the model in CodeFirst approach.

### Week 5 (Fundamental Client Side JavaScript)

Prerequisite Reading - Fundamental JavaScript

https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript

#### Proposed Learning Objective

- Learning Basic JavaScript
- Learning Client Side Scripts.
- Learning how to use NuGet package manager.
- Learning how to use DataTables
- Learning how to use DatePicker

### DoubtFire Submission

- DatePicker 
- DataTables
- Document that explains what is JavaScript in comparison to other language

Most students have difficulties understand what JavaScript is. We need to explain to them how the scene has changed so much and JavaScript is very important. So we will point them to the correct learning resources for JavaScript. We should place an emphasis that JavaScript is not Java. This has been a very common mistake so far. 

There is also a need to tell them the difference between using JQuery UI and things like that. Materials need to be updated to themm the bundles and etc.

We need to tell them regarding various JavaScript standards. EMCA6 for example.

Before we start this week, we should introduce them to what JavaScript is. These days, JavaScript is a monster. 

For this lab, I suggest we introduce the NuGet package manager to them. The current materials are still based on manually downloading the various dependencies. This in my opinion should be avoided.

The other issue is that the lab to showcase how to use DataTables needs to be updated as the examples still showed an older version DataTables.

#### Sample Project

- One project with Datepicker & DataTables

#### Challenges

- Easy - Using jQuery (Simple Feature)
- Medium - Customise DatePicker (Culture API)
- Hard - Server side implementation of searching with Linq
- Expert - Customise DataTables with Server Side Loading (using ODATA)

### Week 6 (Email & File Upload)

DoubtFire Submission
- Email
- FileUpload

We should this lab slightly. My suggestion is to teach them about Login & Validation first before this). This is so that we can not only teach them how to validate the email form that we will be making and also how to batch send email. 

One issue for this week is that some of the assignment requirements were not specifically shown to the students. For example, most students have troubles completing the feature where they can email to multiple users. 

#### Project Examples

- Email (Show them how to send email to multiple users)
- File Upload (With ViewModel Validation, Each File linked to the person who uploaded it)
- File Upload (One stored as a BLOB, another stored using the unique path)

#### Challenges

- Easy - Using gmail instead of Monash SMTP
- Medium - Tailored Email using CSS template
- Hard - Creating time based sending email. - Cron or etc. (For example send email to user when there is an item, in the Shopping cart that has not been checked out after 3 days.)
- Expert - Using SendGrid 

### Week 7 (Client Side JavaScript Frameworks)

#### Proposed Learning Object
- Understanding modern web development
- Understanding the use of WebAPI
- Understanding the benefits of client side frameworks

#### DoubtFire Submission

- AngularJS

The main problem with this week is students do not understand that when using AngularJS, the way of doing this is different. I think we should move this to Week 11 or Week 12. We need to place emphasis that the way we develop a web application using Angular is very different. 

The project previously asked to create "Interfaces" which is actually not needed. Before we approach this lab, we need to place emphasis on how the RESTful design works. Perhaps we need materials from Mobile and Distributed System. We need to place an emphasis on how the "WebAPI" is important and how by creating the WebAPI we distinguished the difference between the server side and client side.

We also relate how a WebAPI is also mentioned in the other subject and how it is very useful for the development of modern web applications.

We need to introduce a tool that allows them to test these RESTful end points. Postman is a good example of a tool that allows us to do it. We should use POSTMAN in the lectures and show them the information returned from the various HTTP request like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

https://apiary.io/

#### Challenges

- Easy - Understanding Programming in JavaScript. There is a need to know that JS is a multi paradigm language.
- Medium - Using NPM or Yarn
- Hard - Using NPM libraries like Axios, or fetch Polyfill, Babel and etc. 
- Expert - Using ReactJS (Thinking in React)

### Week 8 (Validation & Usability)

For this lab, we need to teach the concept of ViewModel. Where and when to use it. Etc.

#### Sample Project

#### Challenges


### Week 9 (Optimisation)

Here, the problem with this lab is the the purpose of optimisation is not seen by the students. Here, I propose that the students or the browsers should be installed with the plugin called "YSlow". This plugin will students to see how they can optimise their web site. We will show them what YSlow reports on various websites and how they can improve on it.

Projects for this weeek will demo how to improve optimisation.

### Week 10 (Web Application Security)

#### Proposed Learning Objective

The previous lab teaches really fundamental things regarding use Recaptha and Recaptha2, however there are more towards Javascript components so this lab is now changed to the way modern web applications are developed instead. For example, there is a need to understand that more web development are very different in comparison to the traditional development. 

The showcase of the Gilt case study. Perhaps REA case study for the students. This is more towards software architecture. This is quite important for the students to know.


### Week 11 (Testing & Deployment)

My suggestion for this week is to introduce testing and deployment. 

We will teach them how to test certain features of the application. This can either be done with unit testing or integration testing. One of the advantages of the MVC is to increase testability however this is not shown to the students.

- Easy - Deployement to Google Cloud
- Medium - Domain Name Mapping
- Hard - Hot Pushing to repo (Deployment Hooks)
- Expert - Using Continous Integration (Either Travis or CircleCI)

### Week 12 (Revision)

No changes.
